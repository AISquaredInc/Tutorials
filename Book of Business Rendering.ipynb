    "# End to End Example of Using the `aisquared` Python SDK to Create a Dashboard Integration Using a `ReverseMLWorkflow`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will go over the creation of a `.air` file that uses a `ReverseMLWorkflow` to pull data from an Amazon S3 bucket and populate a dashboard into multiple end user applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook differs only slightly from the `End-to-end Dashboard.ipynb` example also in this repository.  The main difference between the two notebooks is the `query_selector` parameter in the rendering steps.  The other notebook only has the first selector published, meaning it only looks for the \"general\" tab in Dynamics 365. This notebook expands which selection and injection criteria are expected, allowing the resulting `.air` file to inject on multiple pages."
