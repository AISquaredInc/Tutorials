    "In this notebook, we intend to get the user up to speed regarding using the `aisquared` Python package to create a `.air` file using a simple use case.  This use case will be what we have called a \"Local Analytic\", which involves creating a lookup table that matches words to results.\n",

We will show end-to-end how to create this integration and compile it into a `.air` file.  Let's get started!"
